# Hybrid Losses for Hierarchical Embedding Learning

Code for the ICASSP 2025 paper titled "Hybrid Losses for Hierarchical Embedding Learning"

## Abstract
In traditional supervised learning, the cross-entropy loss treats all incorrect predictions equally, ignoring the relevance or proximity of wrong labels to the correct answer. By leveraging a tree hierarchy for fine-grained labels, we investigate hybrid losses, such as generalised triplet and cross-entropy losses, to enforce similarity between labels within a multi-task learning framework. We propose metrics to evaluate the embedding space structure and assess the modelâ€™s ability to generalise to unseen classes, that is, to infer similar classes for data belonging to unseen categories. Our experiments on OrchideaSOL, a four- level hierarchical instrument sound dataset with nearly 200 detailed categories, demonstrate that the proposed hybrid losses outperform previous works in classification, retrieval, embedding space structure, and generalisation.
